# Exam Organizer

## Purpose
The Exam Organizer is a C++ program designed to help users manage their exam schedules efficiently. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, removing, and viewing exams, allowing users to stay organized and prepared for their exams.

## Design Decisions
- **Modular Structure:** The codebase is structured into separate functions for each operation to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Input Validation:** Input validation is implemented to ensure that users provide valid inputs, such as correct date and time formats, and that the entered subject is not empty.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program presents a simple menu-based interface for users to interact with, ensuring ease of use and navigation.

## Algorithms Used
No specific algorithms are used in this program. Operations are primarily performed using standard C++ functionalities and data structures.

## Data Structures Employed
The main data structure used in the program is the `std::map`, which stores exams mapped to their respective subjects. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of exam information.

## Functions/Modules Created
1. `addExam(map<string, string> &exams)`: Adds a new exam to the list of exams.
2. `updateExam(map<string, string> &exams)`: Updates an existing exam's date and time.
3. `removeExam(map<string, string> &exams)`: Removes an exam from the list of exams.
4. `displayExams(const map<string, string> &exams)`: Displays all exams along with their dates and times.
